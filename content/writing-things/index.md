This is where I will just write random things that I want to write down. Like, it could be just how to write better articles, notes, make better content writing, or just random thoughts that I want to write down. This is for _myself_.

So, why do I need to learn how about writing? I think writing is a crucial skill, like it can help me transit my messages to other more clearly, with better understanding and more effectively. Like, writing here is not just about writing a book, post,.. but about communicating, connecting, and sharing whatever with whoever.

Actually, I am pretty confident with my communication skills, but sometimes I found out that my texts are not yet clear & effective. When I communicate with some of my clients, I found that they don't understand what I mean, or the points i am making. Since I usually use too many technical terms to explain to a non-dev. Or, sometimes I overthought and writing it too complicated. I gotta realized that _who_ I am talking to, they are developer or not, which term would be easy for them to understand and which term is not.
