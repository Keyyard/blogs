This is a collection of my thoughts on _personal growth_, _skill development_, _mindset_, and the messy process of figuring out who I want to become.

# What you'll find here

Personal development feels like such a buzzword these days, doesn't it? Everyone's selling courses and promising to transform your life in 30 days. That's not what this is about.

In my view, real growth happens when you start questioning the things everyone takes for granted. Like why some talented people struggle financially while others with seemingly less skill thrive. Or why certain skills matter more than others in the real world.

These articles are my attempt to make sense of those questions. They're based on observations, experiences, and honestly, a lot of trial and error on my own journey.

This one explores something I've been thinking about for a while. I have met a lot of talented people who ain't making the money they deserve. And my thoughts on it is in the article.

Tho, I don't have all the answers. I'm just figuring things out as I go, same as everyone else. What I do have is a lot of _curiosity_ about why things work the way they do, and I like sharing what I've learned along the way, not all but yea some I do.

Maybe these thoughts will spark something for you, maybe they won't. Either way is totally fine with me. I'm just putting my ideas out there and seeing what happens.

If something here makes you think "yeah, that makes sense" or "tf is he saying" - either reaction is cool with me. Hit me up with your thoughts, I'd love to hear them!
