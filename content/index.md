I wouldn’t usually consider myself a writer or a blogger. This blog is a _personal space_ for me to document my journey, thoughts, and experiences. It’s a place where I can share what I learn, reflect on my progress, and connect with others who might find value in my journey.

I hope I can bring some _inspiration_ and _reflection_ to those who read this. Whatever the case, I’m excited to start this journey and see where it takes me. Appreciate you being here with me, feel free to hit me up with any thoughts or feedback, everything is welcome! (I love small talk too!)
