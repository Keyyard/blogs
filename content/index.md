I wouldn't usually consider myself a writer or a blogger. This blog is a _personal space_ for me to document my journey, thoughts, and experiences. It's a place where I can share what I learn, reflect on my progress, and connect with others who might find value in my journey.

## What You'll Find Here

### [Perspectives](/perspectives/)

This is a collection of my thoughts on _personal growth_, _skill development_, _mindset_, and the messy process of figuring out who I want to become.

### [Writing Things](/writing-things/)

This is where I will just write random things that I want to write down. Like, it could be just how to write better articles, notes, make better content writing, or just random thoughts that I want to write down. This is for _myself_.

I hope I can bring some _inspiration_ and _reflection_ to those who read this. Whatever the case, I'm excited to start this journey and see where it takes me. Appreciate you being here with me, feel free to hit me up with any thoughts or feedback, everything is welcome! (I love small talk too!)
